Flutter BMI Calculator.       This is a simple Flutter app that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for weight (in kg) and height (in feet and inches). It displays the BMI result along with a health status message like "Underweight", "Healthy", or "Overweight". The background color changes based on the BMI category. The app uses TextFields for input and an ElevatedButton to perform the calculation.
